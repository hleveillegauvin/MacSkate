I started working on MacSkate in 2022 as a fun project to learn how to program in C. Everything was developped on a 1990 Macintosh Classic using [Think C 5.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/1417-symantec-think-c-5-0). 

The main book I used to learn how to use the Macintosh ToolBox was:

[Macintosh C Programming Primer: Inside the toolbox using Think C (Volume I, Second Edition), by Dave Mark and Cartwright Reed.](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/pdf/Macintosh_C_Programming_Primer_1992.pdf)

Other useful references:

[Macintosh C Programming By Example, by Kurt W. G. Matthies and Thom Hogan](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/pdf/Macintosh_C_Programming_By_Example_1991.pdf)

[Mac Programming FAQs, by Stephen H. Baker with Dave Mark](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/pdf/Mac_Programming_FAQs_1996.pdf)
